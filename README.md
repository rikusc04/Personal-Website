* **2) About:**
    * This section goes a little bit deeper into my experiences, interests, and skills.
* **3) Skills:**
    * This section includes the languages, tools, frameworks, and platforms I work with. This includes frontend, backend, DevOps, and cloud technologies.
* **4) Projects:**
    * This section includes some of the projects I've worked on, each with a short description and a link to the GitHub Repository.
* **5) Contact:**
    * This section contains some ways to reach me, including my LinkedIn and my Gmail.
